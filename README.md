# NeuCoReClass-AD

This is the official code for a PyTorch implementation of the paper **NeuCoReClass AD: Redefining Self-Supervised Time Series Anomaly Detection**, which can be found here https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00909.
The method has been developed as part of our research on anomaly detection in time series and is designed to be simple, flexible, and extensible. The code allows users to reproduce our experiments and easily extend the method to their own datasets.
